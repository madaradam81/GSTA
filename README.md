This program, QFILTER modifies classical trajectories according 
to the GSTA method:

QFILTER works interactvely, just start the binary file, then
1. you need to give the name of the xyz trajectory file
2. the program asks for the timestep between two snapshots
3. the temperature of the simulation must be entered
